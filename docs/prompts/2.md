Prompt 2: Content Expansion and Visual Integration

Context: We are developing a 5-page professional fishing guide titled "The American Angler’s Guide: Fundamentals, Trends, and the Texas Frontier." We have already established the core text, a Style Guide (Teal/Emerald/Lime palette), and a Visual Manifest that identifies where graphics should go.

The Task:
Please expand the existing text into a full-length draft that will occupy 5 pages in a standard DOCX format. For each section, follow these instructions:

    Expand the Prose: Increase the depth of each section.

        In the Knots section, describe the specific physics of why these knots hold.

        In the Texas Lakes section, add details on the best "seasons" to fish each lake and what specific gear (rods/reels) is recommended.

        Add a new section: "Seasonal Tactics," explaining how fishing changes from Spring (Spawn) to Winter.

    Integrate Visual Placeholders: Based on the Visual Manifest, insert descriptive placeholders in the text where graphics should be placed. Use the following format:

        [VISUAL INSERT: {Template Type} - {Description from Manifest}]
        Graphic Details: Include the data payload and color notes from the Style Guide.

    Apply Tone and Style: Maintain the "Informative, Adventurous, and Natural" mood. Use bolding for key terms and bulleted lists to ensure the 5-page document remains "scannable" rather than a dense wall of text.

    Tables: Convert the "Common Fish Species" section into a detailed 2-column table with expanded descriptions of habitat and behavior.

Goal: Provide the full text for a 5-page document that is ready to be formatted into a final PDF/DOCX.
